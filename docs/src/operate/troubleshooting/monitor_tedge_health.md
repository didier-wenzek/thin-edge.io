# How to monitor health of tedge daemons

The health of tedge daemons like `tedge-mapper`, `tedge-agent` etc can be monitored via MQTT.
These daemons expose MQTT health endpoints which you can query to check if the process is still active or not.

To get the last known health status of a daemon you can subscribe to the following topic

```
tedge/health/<tedge-daemon-name>
```

To refresh the health status of the daemon, publish an empty message on the topic below.

```
tedge/health-check/<tedge-daemon-name>
```

:::note
If the response is not received then most likely the daemon is down, or not responding
:::


For example, `tedge-mapper-c8y` publishes below message on topic `tedge/health/tedge-mapper-c8y` when it starts

```json
{"pid":290854,"status":"up","time":1674739912}
```

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|`pid`|Process ID of the daemon|
|`status`|Daemon status. Possible values are `up` or `down`|
|`time`|Unix timestamp in seconds|

If the tedge daemon gets stopped or crashed or get killed then a `down` message will be published on health status topic
and this will be retained till the tedge daemon is re-launched.

E.g the mapper being killed:

```
tedge mqtt sub 'tedge/health/#'

INFO: Connected
[tedge/health/mosquitto-c8y-bridge] 1
[tedge/health/tedge-mapper-c8y] {"pid":51367,"status":"down"}
[tedge/health/tedge-agent] {"pid":13280,"status":"up","time":1675330667}

```
## Supported MQTT health endpoint topics

The following endpoints are currently supported:

* `tedge/health/tedge-agent`
* `tedge/health/tedge-mapper-c8y`
* `tedge/health/tedge-mapper-az`
* `tedge/health/tedge-mapper-aws`
* `tedge/health/tedge-mapper-collectd`
* `tedge/health/c8y-log-plugin`
* `tedge/health/c8y-configuration-plugin`

All future tedge daemons will also follow the same topic naming scheme convention.

# Mosquitto bridge health endpoints

The mosquitto bridge clients connecting thin-edge devices to the respective cloud platforms also report their health status as retained messages to `tedge/health/<mosquitto-cloud-bridge>` topics.
The health check messages published by these clients are just numeric values `1` or `0`, indicating active and dead bridge clients respectively.

Here are the health endpoints of currently supported clouds, bridged with mosquitto:

| Cloud      | Health topic                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Cumulocity | `tedge/health/mosquitto-c8y-bridge` |
| Azure      | `tedge/health/mosquitto-az-bridge`  |
| AWS        | `tedge/health/mosquitto-aws-bridge` |

Explicit health check requests via `tedge/health-check` topics is not supported by these bridge clients.
Since the health status messages are sent as retained messages, just subscribing to these health topics is sufficient to get the latest status.
