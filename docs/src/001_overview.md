# Overview

Welcome to `thin-edge.io`'s documentation!

`thin-edge.io` is an open-source & cloud-agnostic IoT framework designed to:

- build business-specific IIoT agents running on resource-constrained edge devices
- ease the integration of cloud services, edge computing and operational technologies
- provide the foundations for smart, secure, robust and efficient IIoT agents
- give the freedom of choice for cloud platform, tools and programming language

## How to start

The simplest way to start is with the [beginner-friendly tutorial](./tutorials/getting-started.md)
that introduces `thin-edge.io` and guides you on how to install it on a Raspberry Pi,
connect your device to [Cumulocity IoT](https://www.cumulocity.com/guides/concepts/introduction/),
and then monitor it from the cloud.

To install `thin-edge.io` on your specific hardware, refer to the [installation how-to](howto-guides/002_installation.md).
To connect your device to your cloud, specific tutorials are available for:
- [Cumulocity IoT](tutorials/connect-c8y.md)
- [Azure IoT](tutorials/connect-azure.md)
- [AWS IoT](tutorials/connect-aws.md)
